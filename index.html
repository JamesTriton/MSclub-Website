          with most of them organised by the Microsoft Campus Club. The club was established in 2005 and has been a trailblazer
          since then, among all other technical clubs of the institute. From edifying codes to the minimalist designs,it
          organises quite a handful of events . The club not only focuses on the learning process of newbie coders but also
          provides them with worthy field days in the form of organisation of various events. The club begins its year with
          the most awaited pre innovision event of the institute, "Treasherlocked". Each year the club witnesses around thousands
          of participants from around the globe indulging themselves in extracting solutions for the warped questions from
          their rapidly firing neurones. Apart from organising events that challenge the brain, the club also organises an
          open coding competition "Codenigma" on platforms like Hackerrank and Codechef, evaluating codes of immatures and
          perfectionists on the same platform, a platform which provides knowledge, experience and exposure to each participant.
          Apart from events, the club keeps training the members around with the learning of various codes of various platforms.
          The club also involves itself in designing and proffers the ideas of the members of the design team through the
          events. All of it's events are well articulated and presented by the content team on it's website and other social
          modules. From dawn to dusk, the club members try to bring the best possible events throughout the year for the
          students around. From geeky coding events to events which make you snoop every line of the question and events
          which teach infantile coders, the club keeps working throughout the year.Being among the best technical institutes,
          techies from around the world have seen a suite of events organised here with most of them organised by the Microsoft
